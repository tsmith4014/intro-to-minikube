#intro to minikube with commands

Start Minikube: Minikube is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes locally. You can start it with the following command:
minikube start
Check the status of your pods: A pod is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. You can check the status of your pods with the following command:
kubectl get pods
Check the logs of a pod: If you want to see what's happening inside one of your pods, you can check its logs with the following command:
kubectl logs <pod-name>
Replace <pod-name> with the name of your pod.

Describe a pod: If you want more detailed information about a pod, you can describe it with the following command:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
Replace <pod-name> with the name of your pod.

Expose a pod as a service: If you want to access your application from outside your Kubernetes cluster (for example, from a browser), you need to expose your pod as a service. You can do this with the following command:
kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --type=NodePort --name=<service-name> --port=80
Replace <pod-name> with the name of your pod and <service-name> with the name you want to give to your service.

Access a service: Once your pod is exposed as a service, you can access it with the following command:
minikube service <service-name>

> Replace <service-name> with the name of your service. This command will open up a browser window pointing to your application.

Check the status of your services: You can check the status of your services with the following command:
services
kubectl get services
Remember to replace <pod-name> and <service-name> with the actual names of your pod and service.

This is a basic guide to running an application on Minikube. There's a lot more to Kubernetes and Minikube, but this should give you a good start. If you want to learn more, the official Kubernetes documentation is a great resource.
